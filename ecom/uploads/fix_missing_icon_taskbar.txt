I have solved the icon issue by:

1. Starting the Task Manager
2. Ending the explorer.exe process (Right click on explorer.exe -> End process)
3. Opening a command line window (File -> New Task (Run...) -> Type cmd.exe)
4. In the cmd window type
	cd %userprofile%\appdata\local
5. Now you need to delete the iconcache.db file
	del iconcache.db /a 

6. Exit the cmd window by typing
	exit

7. Starting the explorer again (File -> New Task (Run...) -> Type explorer.exe)
